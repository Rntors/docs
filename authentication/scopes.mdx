Scopes define what actions an API key can perform. This page explains the available scopes and how they control access to Rntor resources.

## Overview

When you generate an API key, it's assigned a set of scopes that determine:
- Which resources can be accessed
- What operations are allowed (read, write, delete)
- Which data is included in responses

## Default Scopes

New API keys are created with these read-only scopes:

| Scope | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `read:bookings` | View bookings and availability |
| `read:customers` | View customer information |
| `read:invoices` | View invoice data and payment status |

```json Default Scope Assignment
{
  "scopes": [
    "read:bookings",
    "read:customers",
    "read:invoices"
  ]
}
```

## Available Scopes

### Bookings

| Scope | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `read:bookings` | View bookings, check availability |
| `write:bookings` | Create and update bookings |
| `delete:bookings` | Cancel bookings |

### Customers

| Scope | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `read:customers` | View customer profiles and companies |
| `write:customers` | Create and update customers |
| `delete:customers` | Deactivate customer accounts |

### Invoices

| Scope | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `read:invoices` | View invoices and payment history |
| `write:invoices` | Create and update invoices |

### Resources

| Scope | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `read:resources` | View resources and locations |
| `write:resources` | Update resource availability and pricing |

### Events

| Scope | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `read:events` | View events and registrations |
| `write:events` | Create events, manage registrations |

### Subscriptions

| Scope | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `read:subscriptions` | View customer subscriptions |
| `write:subscriptions` | Create and modify subscriptions |

## Scope Inheritance

Some scopes implicitly include others:

```
write:bookings → includes → read:bookings
write:customers → includes → read:customers
delete:bookings → includes → read:bookings, write:bookings
```

## Checking Scopes

Your API key's scopes are returned in authentication responses:

```json API Response Headers
{
  "X-Scopes": "read:bookings,read:customers,read:invoices"
}
```

## Insufficient Permissions

Attempting an action without the required scope returns `403 Forbidden`:

```json Error Response
{
  "error": "insufficient_scope",
  "message": "This action requires the 'write:bookings' scope",
  "required_scope": "write:bookings",
  "your_scopes": ["read:bookings", "read:customers", "read:invoices"]
}
```

## Requesting Additional Scopes

<Note>
  Currently, all API keys are created with the default read-only scopes. Additional scopes will be available when the REST API launches. Contact support if you need expanded access for your integration.
</Note>

## Best Practices

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Principle of Least Privilege">
    Request only the scopes your application needs. If you only need to read booking data, don't request write permissions.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Separate Keys for Different Functions">
    Create separate API keys for different parts of your application:
    - Reporting dashboard: `read:bookings`, `read:invoices`
    - Booking widget: `read:resources`, `write:bookings`
    - Admin panel: Full scope access
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Document Required Scopes">
    In your integration documentation, clearly list which scopes are required for each feature.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Future Scopes

The following scopes are planned for the full REST API release:

| Scope | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `read:credits` | View credit balances and transactions |
| `write:credits` | Add or deduct credits |
| `read:tickets` | View support tickets |
| `write:tickets` | Create and update tickets |
| `admin:merchant` | Full administrative access |

## Webhook Scopes

Webhook subscriptions are managed separately through the Svix portal. API key scopes do not affect which webhook events you can subscribe to.

All webhook events are available regardless of your API key scopes.
