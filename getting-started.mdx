This guide walks you through setting up your first Rntor integration. By the end, you'll have API credentials and a working webhook subscription.

## Prerequisites

<Check>
  A Rntor merchant account with owner permissions
</Check>

<Check>
  Access to Settings → Developers in your dashboard
</Check>

## Step 1: Navigate to Developers

1. Log in to your Rntor dashboard
2. Go to **Settings** in the main navigation
3. Select the **Developers** tab

## Step 2: Generate API Credentials

API keys are used to authenticate your integration. While the REST API is coming soon, generating credentials now prepares you for immediate access when it launches.

1. In the **API Keys** section, click **Generate New Key**
2. Enter a descriptive name (e.g., "Production Integration" or "Zapier Connection")
3. Review the default scopes
4. Click **Generate**

<Warning>
  Your **Client Secret** is only shown once. Copy and store it securely immediately after generation.
</Warning>

You'll receive:
- **Client ID**: `rntor_` followed by 24 characters (safe to store, used in requests)
- **Client Secret**: `sk_` followed by 40 characters (keep secret, used for authentication)

```bash Example Credentials
Client ID: rntor_abc123def456ghi789jkl012
Client Secret: sk_mno345pqr678stu901vwx234yza567bcd890efg
```

## Step 3: Set Up Webhook Endpoints

Webhooks let you receive real-time notifications when events occur in Rntor.

1. Switch to the **Webhooks** tab
2. The Svix webhook portal will load
3. Click **Add Endpoint**
4. Enter your endpoint URL (must be HTTPS)
5. Select which events to subscribe to

<Tip>
  Start with a few key events like `booking.created` and `customer.created` to test your integration.
</Tip>

### Testing Locally

For local development, use a tunneling service:

```bash Using ngrok
ngrok http 3000
# Use the generated HTTPS URL as your webhook endpoint
```

## Step 4: Verify Your First Webhook

Once subscribed, trigger an event in Rntor (e.g., create a booking) and verify:

1. Your endpoint receives the POST request
2. The payload contains the expected data
3. Signature verification passes (see [Security](/webhooks/security))

```javascript Example: Logging Received Webhooks
app.post('/webhooks/rntor', (req, res) => {
  console.log('Received webhook:', req.body);
  
  const { event_type, _meta } = req.body;
  console.log(`Event: ${event_type}`);
  console.log(`Merchant: ${_meta.merchant_id}`);
  
  res.status(200).send('OK');
});
```

## Rate Limits

All API requests are rate limited to ensure platform stability:

| Limit | Value |
|-------|-------|
| Requests per minute | 60 |
| Burst limit | 10 requests |

Exceeding these limits returns a `429 Too Many Requests` response.
