# API Keys

API keys authenticate your application when making requests to the Rntor API. This page explains how to generate, use, and manage your credentials.

## Overview

Each API key consists of two parts:

| Component | Format | Purpose |
|-----------|--------|---------|
| **Client ID** | `rntor_` + 24 characters | Identifies your application. Safe to include in logs. |
| **Client Secret** | `sk_` + 40 characters | Authenticates requests. Keep this secret! |

```bash Example Credentials
Client ID:     rntor_abc123def456ghi789jkl012
Client Secret: sk_mno345pqr678stu901vwx234yza567bcd890efg
```

## Current Status

<Note>
  The REST API is **live** with 17 endpoints (13 read + 4 write). See the [API Reference](/api-reference/overview) for full documentation.
</Note>

## Generating API Keys

### Via Dashboard

1. Navigate to **Settings → Developers → API Keys**
2. Click **Generate New Key**
3. Enter a descriptive name for the key
4. Review the assigned scopes
5. Click **Generate**

<Warning>
  The **Client Secret** is only displayed once upon creation. Copy it immediately and store it securely. If lost, you'll need to regenerate the key.
</Warning>

### Key Details

When you generate a key, you'll receive:

```json
{
  "client_id": "rntor_abc123def456ghi789jkl012",
  "client_secret": "sk_mno345pqr678stu901vwx234yza567bcd890efg",
  "name": "Production Integration",
  "scopes": ["read:bookings", "read:customers", "read:invoices"],
  "created_at": "2024-01-15T10:30:00Z"
}
```

## Using API Keys

Authenticate requests using the `Authorization` header with your Client Secret and the `X-Client-Id` header with your Client ID:

```bash HTTP Request
curl -X GET "https://iwdewzswethsnvwvpind.supabase.co/functions/v1/public-api/bookings" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_CLIENT_SECRET" \
  -H "X-Client-Id: YOUR_CLIENT_ID"
```

```javascript JavaScript
const response = await fetch('https://iwdewzswethsnvwvpind.supabase.co/functions/v1/public-api/bookings', {
  headers: {
    'Authorization': `Bearer ${clientSecret}`,
    'X-Client-Id': clientId,
    'Content-Type': 'application/json'
  }
});
```

```python Python
import requests

response = requests.get(
    'https://iwdewzswethsnvwvpind.supabase.co/functions/v1/public-api/bookings',
    headers={
        'Authorization': f'Bearer {client_secret}',
        'X-Client-Id': client_id,
        'Content-Type': 'application/json'
    }
)
```

## Managing Keys

### Viewing Active Keys

The API Keys tab shows all active keys with:
- Key name
- Client ID (visible)
- Creation date
- Last used date

### Regenerating a Secret

If your secret is compromised:

1. Click the **Regenerate** button next to the key
2. Confirm the action
3. Copy the new secret immediately
4. Update your application with the new secret

<Warning>
  Regenerating a secret immediately invalidates the old one. Update all applications using the key before regenerating.
</Warning>

### Revoking a Key

To permanently disable a key:

1. Click the **Revoke** button next to the key
2. Confirm the action

Revoked keys cannot be restored. Create a new key if needed.

## Security Best Practices

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Never expose secrets in client-side code">
    Client secrets should only be used in server-side code. Never include them in:
    - JavaScript bundles
    - Mobile app code
    - Public repositories
    - Logs or error messages
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Use environment variables">
    Store credentials in environment variables, not in code:
    ```bash
    export RNTOR_CLIENT_ID="rntor_..."
    export RNTOR_CLIENT_SECRET="sk_..."
    ```
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Rotate keys periodically">
    Regenerate API keys periodically (e.g., every 90 days) to limit exposure from potential leaks.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Use separate keys per environment">
    Create different keys for development, staging, and production environments.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Monitor key usage">
    Regularly review the "Last Used" timestamp to detect unauthorized access.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Rate Limits

API keys are subject to rate limiting:

| Limit | Value |
|-------|-------|
| Requests per minute | 60 |
| Burst limit | 10 requests |

Exceeding limits returns `429 Too Many Requests`. Implement exponential backoff in your retry logic.

## Troubleshooting

### Invalid Credentials

If you receive a `401 Unauthorized` response:

1. Verify the Client ID and Secret are correct
2. Check for extra whitespace or line breaks
3. Ensure the key hasn't been revoked
4. Confirm the key has the required scopes

### Key Not Found

If the Client ID isn't recognized:

1. Check you're using the correct environment (production vs. staging)
2. Verify the key was created for the correct merchant account
