## OAuth 2.0

The Rntor API uses OAuth 2.0 for authentication. All API requests must include a valid access token in the `Authorization` header.

```bash
Authorization: Bearer YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN
```

## Getting Your API Credentials

1. Log in to your [Rntor Dashboard](https://app.rntor.com)
2. Navigate to **Settings** → **API & Integrations**
3. Click **Create API Key**
4. Copy your Client ID and Client Secret

<Warning>
Keep your Client Secret secure. Never expose it in client-side code or public repositories.
</Warning>

## Required Headers

All API requests must include the following headers:

| Header | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `Authorization` | Your API client secret as a Bearer token |
| `X-Client-ID` | Your API client ID |
| `Content-Type` | `application/json` for requests with a body |

## Example Request

```bash
curl -X GET "https://api.rntor.com/v1/networks" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_CLIENT_SECRET" \
  -H "X-Client-ID: YOUR_CLIENT_ID"
```

## Scopes

API keys can be configured with specific scopes to limit access:

| Scope | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `read:bookings` | Read booking data |
| `write:bookings` | Create and modify bookings |
| `read:members` | Read member information |
| `write:members` | Create and modify members |
| `read:resources` | Read resource data |
| `write:resources` | Create and modify resources |
| `read:invoices` | Read invoice data |
| `write:invoices` | Create and modify invoices |

<Info>
Request only the scopes your integration needs. This follows the principle of least privilege.
