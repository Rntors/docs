## Overview

The Rntor API implements rate limiting to ensure fair usage and maintain service quality for all users.

## Rate Limits

| Plan | Requests per Minute | Requests per Day |
|------|---------------------|------------------|
| Standard | 60 | 10,000 |
| Professional | 120 | 50,000 |
| Enterprise | 300 | Unlimited |

## Rate Limit Headers

Every API response includes headers to help you track your usage:

| Header | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `X-RateLimit-Limit` | Maximum requests allowed per minute |
| `X-RateLimit-Remaining` | Requests remaining in current window |
| `X-RateLimit-Reset` | Unix timestamp when the limit resets |

## Example Response Headers

```http
X-RateLimit-Limit: 60
X-RateLimit-Remaining: 45
X-RateLimit-Reset: 1704067200
```

## Handling Rate Limits

When you exceed the rate limit, you'll receive a `429 Too Many Requests` response:

```json
{
  "error": {
    "code": "rate_limit_exceeded",
    "message": "Rate limit exceeded. Please retry after 30 seconds.",
    "retry_after": 30
  }
}
```

## Best Practices

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Implement Exponential Backoff">
    When receiving a 429 response, wait for the specified `retry_after` duration before retrying. For subsequent failures, double the wait time.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Cache Responses">
    Cache API responses when possible to reduce the number of requests you need to make.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Use Webhooks">
    Instead of polling for changes, use webhooks to receive real-time notifications.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Batch Requests">
    Where possible, use bulk endpoints to reduce the total number of API calls.
